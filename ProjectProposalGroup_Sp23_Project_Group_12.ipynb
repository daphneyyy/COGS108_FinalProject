    "- Include a general introduction to your topic\n",
    "\n",
    "> The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on global economies and societies, resulting in widespread changes to daily life, business operations, and travel patterns. While this has brought many challenges, it has also had an unexpected effect on the environment, including global warming. With fewer people commuting to work, reduced air travel, and lower industrial activity, the levels of carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases have decreased significantly in many parts of the world. As the world begins to recover from the pandemic and returns to some semblance of normalcy, it is important to assess the long-term impact of these changes on the environment and climate change.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In this context, we are exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the environment and climate change. We will be comparing and examining the data before the pandemic begins, and during the pandemic. We will also be comparing and examining the data after the pandemic ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include explanation of what work has been done previously\n",
    "\n",
    "> Several studies have examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. One study published in the journal [^Nature Climate Change] estimated that global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions declined by 17% during the peak of the pandemic in early April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The study also found that daily CO2 emissions decreased by up to 26% in individual countries.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Other studies have also reported significant reductions in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in major cities and regions around the world, including China, Europe, and the United States. For example, a study published in the journal [^Geophysical Research Letters] found that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, a major air pollutant, decreased by up to 60% in some cities in China during the lockdown period in early 2020.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> However, some studies have also pointed out that the effect of the pandemic on global emissions may be temporary and limited. For example, a study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment noted that although global emissions decreased in 2020, they are expected to rebound in the coming years as economies recover and travel resumes.\n",

    "**Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to significant reductions in human activities (thus reduction of greenhouse gas emissions), will have a temporary slowing effect on global temperature increase and sea level rise.\n",
